    "1.What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "Machine Learning is a way of identifying the pattern of the dataset. The term learning means slowly and gradually coming to the more accurate value of the parameters which can be used to define the relationship. In more precise manner it uses experience (Data), and perfoms some mathematical calculations on it and tries to find the more accurate value of the parameter thus improving the performace of the machine.\n",

    "2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "1.Useful in redeucing manLabour/ Manual detection: Instead of manually detecting faults , machine learning can use steaming data to detect fault and thus reducing the cost of manpower deploymnet at location site.\n",
    "2.Model REtraining Approach: Preparing a system manually to detect some pattern based on hardcoded patterns is very difficult to maintain and needs a regular manual check. With machine learning it is possible to make the machine learn automatically just by feeding a newset of data.\n",
    "3.MAchine learning is easier to implent for solving complex problems  thus avoiding a lot of fine tuning or long list of rules.\n",
    "4.Working with real time data with manual approach with limited resources is quiet difficult howsoever machine learning make sit easier even with limited resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "When within the dataset there exist a relationship between one variable with the rest of the other variable or when variable , which is also known as target, can be described or the variance of the variable can be explained  by using rest of the variables is known as Labeled training set. This type of dataset is exceptionally used for predicting the outcome based on certain values. Set of input features and target is captured the machine is trained on the training dataset . The features of validataion dataset is fiven to the machine and output is generated . The performance is calculated based on the difference between the actual and predicted target of the training and  validation dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "In such system machine is trained with streamning data. Data is given to the system in a sequential manner or in batches.. This type of learning requires to be fast and system cvan learn new data on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "Core Learning means when the complete data is available on one system or it is possible to feed the comp-lete data to the machine to train in one go. Hosoever Onlinelearning/Incremental Learning/OutOf Core Learning means the data is given to the machine in batches or streaming data not in one go and the data is hhuge so cant be stored in one single machine so data is fed in batches to the machine and the model keeps on taking the dataset and training itself till it has run on all the data.\n",

    "11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "Instance BAsed Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    "Values of model parameter can be obtained by training the dataset to a machine learning algorithm. It can start with some random initialization and then slowly gradually it tweaks to come to a optimum values. Howsoever even after we gate our optimum model parameters machine sometimes need more fine tuning which can be done by tweaking Hyperparameters which are meant to bring better performance measures.\n",

    "15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "Test set is is never open to the machine while it is learning , it is available to the machine only once the machine is trained, finetuned and ready to work with new data. Test data can termed as suprise or new data to the machine  and machine's performance is finally checked and validated through this test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "While the model is in learning stage and it needs to be tested to measure the performance of the machine validation datset is used . Base on this the machine is again retrianed with little or more modification, finetuning can be reset to some other values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "While working with machin elearning we can face majorly 3 problems post training overfitting,underfitting and data mismatch. The validation set and test set should be represenattive of training dataset. But there could be situation when they don not represent each other. \n",
    "Suppose we have trained a model using training dataset. Post training to check perform,ance measure we use validation dataset, there could be 2 situations now. Model will give perform good wiht validation dataset or it will not. If it doesnt perform well with validation dataset we cans ay that either the model is overfitting or theere is data mismatch problem which means the validation dataset is not representative of training dataset. But right now we do not have any ways to check the exact problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "While training we can keep a portion of the training dataset separate which is called as train-dev set, and post training we can check the performance of the model on train-dev set and validation set both. If the model performs well with train-dev set and poor with validation set then we can say model is not overfitting but the validation dataset is clearly not the representative of the training dataset. In this case we need to change our dataset so that they can be representative of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "Machine will face the problem of overfitting and thus producing not so accurate result with new data\n"
