    "1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human learns via sight,smell,touch,hear,taste through eyes,nose,skin,ear,tongue respectively which can be treated as input receptors. A new born baby can be treated as untrained model and a continous streaming of data is fed into his system via these organs and it senses all these innformations and stores in his data base and the process continues. \n",
    "Example: Touch can differentiate between hot and cold(classifcation), how much cold and hot(regression), eyes can differentiate between colors,etc\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
    "1. Human can use their experience to group different items into several categories based on dominant features. Sparrow, eagle, pigeon have wings , albatross also has wings so they allc an be put together in one group. This is called unsupervised learning in machine learning where dataset doesnt have any labelled columns.\n",
    "2. Human can use their experience to classify an animal from a set of different animals. For example if the picture of a rat is shown to human , then set of 12 differeent animals is shown to him then on the basis of training he can classify rats from the set of animals. This is called supervised learning in machine learning where dataset have a labelled column.\n",
    "3. A person working on a project and running the lines of code will get motivated to work on next line if the current line.function executes without throwing error. This is called reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?\n",
    "MAchine learning utilizes whole lot of data to uncover/learn the hidden pattern in the dataset. Most of the algorithms in Machine Learning works on equation and tries to find the value of the parameters using the dataset. It tries to minimize the difference between actual and predicted and thus on reaching the global minima it acquires the optimum value. These parameters are tested on train-dev set and validation dataset to ensure if there is any dataset mismatch or overfitting taking place. If yes these parameters are modified again either by taking more accurate values or by tuning the hyper parameters. If there is not any mismatch/overfitting/underfitting the training parameters are checked with test dataset. BAsed on the problem the performance measure are checked and ensured to achieve less error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the terms \"penalty\" and \"reward\" in the context of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "The learning system observes the environment and then select and chooses actions to perform. If the selected action yields desirable result, it gets reward and it moves in the forward direction for next action. Hwsoever if it doesnt yield desirable reuslt it gets penalty , then the system rectifies the action and updates its action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the term \"learning as a search\"?\n",
    "There is not any bad or good algorith, bad or good parameters, bad or good hyperparameters. Any algorithm, parameter,hyperparameter that solves the problem of the specific dataset is best for that specific problem. for every problem, every dataset a search has to be done to come to optimum algorithm, parameter and hyperparameter value.  \n",
    "\n",

    "6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?\n",
    "1. Reduce time \n",
    "2. Increase efficiency and accuracy\n",
    "3. Solve complex problem\n",
    "4. Designing a system which can update itself based on any changes in the dataset-model retraining\n",
    "5. Reducing man power\n",
    "MAchine Learning  is able to work well with folllowing problems:\n",
    "1.Regression\n",
    "2.Classifcation\n",
    "3.Grouping/CLustering\n",
    "4.Association\n",
    "5.Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Human learning also needs a database to store all the data he has aquired till date and learn from it , howsoever it not always efficient, reliable, to solve business problem. There is a limit to it as it is not scalable. Sometimes it is not even authentic. Human Learning is fast with limited dataset and it doesnt perform well with huge datset where as machine learning advanced algos are able to handle big data. \n",
    "Similarities:\n",
    "Human can use their experience to group different items into several categories based on dominant features,to classify an animal from a set of different animals. A person working on a project and running the lines of code will get motivated to work on next line if the current line/function executes without throwing error else he will have to rectify the current action. The approach of machine learning and human learning is same but the efficiciency, scalability,complexity, nature to handle different type of data (variety,volume),etc are different.\n",

    "7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration.\n",

    "\n",
    "8. Provide an example of the abstraction method.\n",
    "In terms of machine learning abstraction can be defined in terms of keeping the test dataset protected when the model is learning. Not exposing the dataset to the untrained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?\n",
    "The idea is to reach that optimum value of parameters which works well with all datasets including train dataset, train-dev, validationas well as test dataset. This reduces the chance of introducing overfitting/underfitting And thus generating a model which is accurate, reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?\n",
    "Classification is a task of predicting the class for any input set of features based on probability value rather than predicting any Continous numerical value. Log of odds are calculated, sigmoid function on logg of odds is applied to restrict the output between 0 and 1 (binary) . A threshold is decided to differentiate between two classes depending upon the nature of problem.\n",
    "The performance measures are based on true classification and false classifcation.  Sometimes accuracy(percentage of true classifcation) doesnt decide how good or bad a model is. Performance measures such as Recall, precision, F1score decides the reliability of the model. Classification Model reliability is problem specific. \n",
    "For example: Detecting cancer causing cell Problem want recall performance measure o be high rather than precision which means it is ok to receive non cancer causing cells present in the body (whenn it is actually absent) rather than compromising result when the prediction says that cancer causing cellss are abset when in real it is present. \n",
    "This is not case with regression Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression.\n",
    "Task of predicting continous numerical value  for any input set of features when there is no correlation between input set of features(multicollinearity), one or more feature capturing the most of the variance of target column. The difference between actual and predicted is calculated and termed as error. There should not be any realation between errors and predicted values, it should be random(heterosedacity should be less). Lower the error better the model is. Gradient descent/Batch Gradient Dscent or Stochastic Gradient Descent  technique is used to minimize the error by slowly and gradually tweaking the parameter values and reaching the global minima. \n",
    "The cost function of the regression is a convex function which assumes only one global minima and this is the reasion gRadient descent works well with Cost function of Regreesion. Cost function is differentiated wrt different parameters and new value of the parameters are calculated at each small step. The steps are kept small in ordfer to reach the global minima and the negative/positive slope decides the movement of steps in gradient descent.\n",

    "Classification is a task of predicting the class for any input set of features based on probability value rather than predicting any Continous numerical value. Log of odds are calculated, sigmoid function on logg of odds is applied to restrict the output between 0 and 1 (binary) . A threshold is decided to differentiate between two classes depending upon the nature of problem.\n",
    "Task of predicting continous numerical value  for any input set of features.\n",

    "iii. Studying without supervision\n",
    "Task which can make group nbased on some dominent features. The dataset doesnt contain any target column. Based on    similarity considering the traits of the dataspoints.\n",
    "iv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement.\n",
    "The learning system observes the environment and then select and chooses actions to perform. If the selected action yields desirable result, it gets reward and it moves in the forward direction for next action. Hwsoever if it doesnt yield desirable reuslt it gets penalty , then the system rectifies the action and updates its action. ANd will not repeat the action at that point which has yielded penalty to the system."
