    "1. What are the key tasks involved in getting ready to work with machine learning modeling?\n",
    "There are varioous steps in machine learning modelling and a amchine learning pipeline is usually build to achieve this.\n",
    "Step1: Data Cleaning\n",
    "Step2: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Step3: Feature Engineering\n",
    "Step4:: MOdel Training\n",
    "Step5: HyperParameter Tuning\n",
    "Step6: MOdel Deployment\n",
    "Step7: MOdel Retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give a specific example for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Quantitative:\n",
    "    1.1 Discrete EXample: Number of Passengers onboarding into a flight.\n",
    "    1.2 COntinous eXAMPLE: Height, Age,etc\n",
    "        1.2.1 Ratio: \n",
    "1. Absolute Point Zero – Ratio data is measured on a ratio scale. One of the distinctive characteristics of ratio data is the true absolute zero point, which makes the data relevant and meaningful in a manner where it is right to say, “one object is twice as long as the other” or 4 has twice the value as 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. No Negative Numerical Value – Ratio data doesn’t have any negative numerical value. For a value to be a ratio data researcher, first must evaluate if it meets all the criteria of interval data and has an absolute zero point. For example, weight cannot be negative, -20 Kgs doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculation – Ratio data values can be added, subtracted, divided, and multiplied. A unique statistical analysis is possible for ratio data. Chi-square can be calculated using a ratio scale for ratio data. Mean, mode and median can also be calculated for the ratio data.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.2.2 Interval: Interval data, also called an integer, is defined as a data type which is measured along a scale, in which each point is placed at equal distance from one another. Interval data always appears in the form of numbers or numerical values where the distance between the two points is standardized and equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval data cannot be multiplied or divided, however, it can be added or subtracted. Interval data is measured on an interval scale. A simple example of interval data: The difference between 100 degrees Fahrenheit and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is the same as 60 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "Interval data doesn’t have a defined absolute zero point which is present in ratio data. The lack of absolute point zero makes comparisons of direct magnitudes impossible. For example, Object A is twice as large as Object B is not a possibility in interval data.  Absolute zero point is arbitrary, which means a variable can be measured even if it has a negative value like temperature can be -10 below zero but height cannot be below zero.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. One can measure time during the day using a 12-hour clock, this is a good example of interval data. Time in a 12-hour format is a rotational measure that keeps restarting from zero at set periodicity. These numbers are on an interval scale as the distance between them is measurable and comparable. For example, the difference between 5 minutes and 10 minutes is the same as 15 minutes and 20 minutes in a 12-hour clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The temperature measured in Fahrenheit and Celsius but not in Kelvin. If you measure temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius then it will be considered interval data as 0 is arbitrary. But in Kelvin, 0 is absolute. There can’t be a temperature below zero degrees in Kelvin.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you calculate intelligence score in an IQ test. There is no zero point for IQ. According to psychological studies, a person cannot have zero intelligence, therefore in this example, zero is arbitrary. IQ is numeric data expressed in intervals using a fixed measurement scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test scores of examination like SAT. Scores in SAT test are in the range of 200-800. The numbers from 0 to 200 are not used when they scale the raw score (number of questions answered correctly) to the section score. The reference point is not an absolute zero, thus, it qualifies to become interval data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Qualitative\n",
    "    2.1 Ordinal: Where order matters. EXample: Movie Ratings[\"Good\",\"BAd\",\"Worst\"]\n",
    "    2.2 Nominal: Notational DAta where order doesnt matter. EXample Gender[\"MAle\",\"Female\"]\n",
    "3. Distinguish:\n",
    "\n",
    "           1. Numeric vs. categorical attributes\n",
    "numerical data is either continous or dicrete and order always matters. Functions like min,max,std,mean,etc works well with such data. \n",
    "In categorical data Ordinal: Where order matters. and Nominal: Notational DAta where order doesnt matter\n",
    "\n",
    "           2.  Feature selection vs. dimensionality reduction\n",
    "Feature selection meansignoring few of the columns while dimensionality reduction means capturies certain amount of variances of the features by reducing the dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make quick notes on any two of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "            1. The histogram\n",
    "usually designed for continous data where the frequency is calculated over a range of values in terms of probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. Use a scatter plot\n",
    "the graph which is used to explain the movement of one variable wrt other variable\n",
    "\n",
    "            3.PCA (Personal Computer Aid)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Why is it necessary to investigate data? Is there a discrepancy in how qualitative and quantitative data are explored?\n",
    "The way of handling categorical and numerical data is different. MAchine understands number so for categorical values it is first encoded before passing it  to machine. The classes of the categorical data needs to present in sufficient numbers so that machine can understand the pattern and if any of the class is not present in required quantity it can bbe treated as outlier and for numerical data any nuumerical value which is not in the range of the colunmn can be termed as outlier and in both the cases it needs to be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the various histogram shapes? What exactly are ‘bins'?\n",
    "    1. Bell Shaped\n",
    "    2. Skewed : Left and Right\n",
    "    3. Uniform\n",
    "    4. RAndom\n",
    "    5. Bimodal\n",
    "Every numerical column can be designed over a range , number of bins takes discrete value and divides this complete range by bin value to get  smaller sections of  ranges. And freuqency in terms of probability distribution is calculated based on these bins created.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How do we deal with data outliers?\n",
    "We usually remove them or we can choose alogrithms like xgboost, kmedian, random forest which are least affected by outliers. Howsoever the ideal practice is to remove them using boxplot, IQR , zScore\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are the various central inclination measures? Why does mean vary too much from median in certain data sets?\n",
    "1. Mean\n",
    "2. Median\n",
    "3. MODe\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a mathematical calculation involved in Mean : Sum of all points/ total number of points. Increasing value of on eof the datapoints can drastically bring effect in overall calculation and bringing right /left skewness. Howsoever median is calculated by arranging the datapoints in the order of mangintude and middle value is taken in case odd number of data points and average of two middle values are taken in case of even number of data points\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Describe how a scatter plot can be used to investigate bivariate relationships. Is it possible to find outliers using a scatter plot?\n",
    "the sactter plot is used to explain the variations of one variable wrt other variable. We can visualize the concentration of data points. Howsoeverr if any of the datapoint is not located in the dense area but in area where there are very less or no other datapoints present it can be describes as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Describe how cross-tabs can be used to figure out how two variables are related\n",
    "Chi Square Test uses cross tabs to find if the groups/classes present in one column is creating any significant impact on any other column or not. For example There are 3 categories in SubjectColumn [\"Phy\", \"Chem\", \"MAths\"] and there is a Percentage_Scored Column. questions like Does Students who opted Phy have secured better marks than Students who opted Chem and MAths.
